In this article we compare the restrictions imposed by the four most popular multivariate GARCH models, and introduce a set of robust conditional moment tests to detect misspecification. We demonstrate that the choice of a multivariate volatility model can lead to substantially different conclusions in any application that involves forecasting dynamic covariance matrices (like estimating the optimal hedge ratio or deriving the risk minimizing portfolio). We therefore introduce a general model which nests these four models and their natural "asymmetric" extensions. The new model is applied to study the dynamic relation between large and small firm returns.},

By working out in detail a small, fictitious numerical example, the writers exhibit the various steps involved in investigating the dependence between two random variables and in modeling it using copulas. Simple graphical tools and numerical techniques are presented for selecting an appropriate model, estimating its parameters, and checking its goodness-of-fit. A larger, realistic application of the methodology to hydrological data is then presented. }

Copula models are widely used in financial econometrics and risk management. They are considered to be a competitive alternative to the Gaussian dependence structure. The dynamic structure of the dependence between the data can be modeled by allowing either the copula function or the dependence parameter to be time-varying. First, we give a brief description of eight different models, among which there are fully parametric, semiparametric, and adaptive methods. The purpose of this study is to compare the applicability of each particular model in different cases. We conduct a simulation study to show the performance for model selection, to compare the model fit for different setups and to study the ability of the models to estimate the (latent) time-varying dependence parameter. Finally, we provide an illustration by applying the competing models on the same financial dataset and compare their performance by means of Value-at-Risk.},

This methodology is relevant for estimating risk-management measures, such as portfolio value-at-risk, pricing multi-name financial instruments, and portfolio asset allocation.

    abstract = {Sequential (one-by-one) rather than simultaneous estimation of multiple breaks is investigated in this paper. The advantage of this method lies in its computational savings and its robustness to misspecification in the number of breaks. The number of least-squares regressions required to compute all of the break points is of order T, the sample size. Each estimated break point is shown to be consistent for one of the true ones despite underspecification of the number of breaks. More interestingly and somewhat surprisingly, the estimated break points are shown to be T-consistent, the same rate as the simultaneous estimation. Limiting distributions are also derived. Unlike simultaneous estimation, the limiting distributions are generally not symmetric and are influenced by regression parameters of all regimes. A simple method is introduced to obtain break point estimators that have the same limiting distributions as those obtained via simultaneous estimation. Finally, a procedure is proposed to consistently estimate the number of breaks.},
