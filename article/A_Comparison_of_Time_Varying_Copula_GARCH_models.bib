The dynamic structure of the dependence between the data can be modeled by allowing either the copula function or the dependence parameter to be time-varying. First, we give a brief description of eight different models, among which there are fully parametric, semiparametric, and adaptive methods. The purpose of this study is to compare the applicability of each particular model in different cases. We conduct a simulation study to show the performance for model selection, to compare the model fit for different setups and to study the ability of the models to estimate the (latent) time-varying dependence parameter. Finally, we provide an illustration by applying the competing models on the same financial dataset and compare their performance by means of Value-at-Risk.},

The advantage of this method lies in its computational savings and its robustness to misspecification in the number of breaks. The number of least-squares regressions required to compute all of the break points is of order T, the sample size. Each estimated break point is shown to be consistent for one of the true ones despite underspecification of the number of breaks. More interestingly and somewhat surprisingly, the estimated break points are shown to be T-consistent, the same rate as the simultaneous estimation. Limiting distributions are also derived. Unlike simultaneous estimation, the limiting distributions are generally not symmetric and are influenced by regression parameters of all regimes. A simple method is introduced to obtain break point estimators that have the same limiting distributions as those obtained via simultaneous estimation. Finally, a procedure is proposed to consistently estimate the number of breaks.},

For example, the mean growth rate of a nonstationary series may be subject to occasional, discrete shifts. The econometrician is presumed not to observe these shifts directly, but instead must draw probabilistic inference about whether and when they may have occurred based on the observed behavior of the series. The paper presents an algorithm for drawing such estimation of population parameters by the method of maximum likelihood and provides the foundation for forecasting future values of the series. An empirical application of this technique to postwar U.S. real GNP suggests that the periodic shift from a positive growth rate to a negative growth rate is a recurrent feature of the U.S. business cycle, and indeed could be used as an objective criterion for defining and measuring economic recessions. The estimated parameter values suggest that a typical economic recession is associated with a 3 percent permanent drop in the level of GNP.},

    abstract={The interest in business-cycle asymmetry has been steadily increasing over the past 15 years. Most research has focused on the different behavior of macroeconomic variables during expansions and contractions, which by now is well documented. Recent evidence suggests that such a two-phase characterization of the business cycle might be too restrictive. In particular, it might be worthwhile to decompose the recovery phase in a high-growth phase (immediately following the trough of a cycle) and a subsequent moderate-growth phase. The issue of multiple regimes in the business cycle is addressed using smooth-transition autoregressive (STAR) models. A possible limitation of STAR models as they currently are used is that essentially they deal with only two regimes. We propose a generalization of the STAR model such that more than two regimes can be accommodated. It is demonstrated that the class of multiple-regime STAR (MRSTAR) models can be obtained from the two-regime model in a simple way. The main properties of the MRSTAR model and several issues that are relevant for empirical specification are discussed in detail. In particular, a Lagrange multiplier-type test is derived that can be used to determine the appropriate number of regimes. A limited simulation study indicates its practical usefulness. Application of the new model class to U.S. real GNP provides evidence in favor of the existence of multiple business-cycle phases.},

The transitions describing recovery from recession are very similar for the two variables.

The latter two features are often observed characteristics of empirical datasets, and we formally incorporate them in the inferential process. A general procedure for introducing skewness into symmetric distributions is first proposed. Even though this allows for a great deal of flexibility in distributional shape, tail behavior is not affected. Applying this skewness procedure to a Student t distribution, we generate a "skewed Student" distribution, which displays both flexible tails and possible skewness, each entirely controlled by a separate scalar parameter. The linear regression model with a skewed Student error term is the main focus of the article. We first characterize existence of the posterior distribution and its moments, using standard improper priors and allowing for inference on skewness and tail parameters. For posterior inference with this model, we suggest a numerical procedure using Gibbs sampling. The latter proves very easy to implement and renders the analysis of quite challenging problems a practical possibility. Some examples illustrate the use of this model in empirical data analysis.},

However, in the context of many models of financial risk, interest centers on more than just a single point of the forecast distribution. For example, value-at-risk models that are currently in extremely wide use form interval forecasts. Many other important financial calculations also involve estimates not summarized by a point forecast. Although some techniques are currently available for assessing interval and density forecasts, existing methods tend to display low power in sample sizes typically available. This article suggests a new approach to evaluating such forecasts. It requires evaluation of the entire forecast distribution, rather than a scalar or interval. The information content of forecast distributions combined with ex post realizations is enough to construct a powerful test even with sample sizes as small as 100.},

    abstract = {We exploit ideas from high-dimensional data analysis to derive new portmanteau tests that are based on the trace of the square of the mth order autocorrelation matrix. The resulting statistics are weighted sums of the squares of the sample autocorrelation coefficients that, unlike many other tests appearing in the literature, are numerically stable even when the number of lags considered is relatively close to the sample size. The statistics behave asymptotically as a linear combination of chi-squared random variables and their asymptotic distribution can be approximated by a gamma distribution. The proposed tests are modified to check for nonlinearity and to check the adequacy of a fitted nonlinear model. Simulation evidence indicates that the proposed goodness of fit tests tend to have higher power than other tests appearing in the literature, particularly in detecting long-memory nonlinear models. The efficacy of the proposed methods is demonstrated by investigating nonlinear effects in Apple, Inc., and Nikkei-300 daily returns during the 2006â2007 calendar years.

    abstract = {Tests are proposed for detecting possible changes in parameters when the observations are obtained sequentially in time. While deriving the tests the alternative one has in mind specifies the parameter process as a martingale. The distribution theory of these tests relies on the large-sample results; that is, only the limiting null distributions are known (except in very special cases). The main tool in establishing these limiting distributions is weak convergence of stochastic processes. Suppose that we have vector-valued observations x1,...,xn obtained sequentially in time (or ordered in some other linear fashion). Their joint distribution is described by determining the initial distribution for x1 and the conditional distribution for each xk given the past up to xk - 1. Suppose further that these distributions depend on a p-dimensional parameter vector θ. At least locally (i.e., in a short time period) this may be more or less legitimate. In the long run, however, the possibility of some changes in the observation-generating process should be taken into account. Specifically, it is assumed here that those changes occur through a parameter variation in the form of a martingale. The martingale specification has an advantage of covering several types of departure of constancy: for example, a single jump at an unknown time point (the so-called change-point model) or slow random variation (typically random walk). The tests are derived by first finding the locally most powerful test against a martingale-type alternative when the starting value of the parameter process is known. After some simplification a test having a known numerically tractable limiting distribution is developed. When the starting point is unknown an efficient estimate is substituted for it. In addition, the corresponding limiting distribution is established. The proposed tests turn out to be based on cumulative sums of the score function (the derivative of the log-likelihood).},

Various new and existing ARCH models including a partially nonparametric one are compared and estimated with daily Japanese stock return data. New diagnostic tests are presented which emphasize the asymmetry of the volatility response to news. Our results suggest that the model by Glosten, Jagannathan, and Runkle is the best parametric model. The EGARCH also can capture most of the asymmetry; however, there is evidence that the variability of the conditional variance implied by the EGARCH is too high.},

    abstract = {Weekly rates of the European Monetary System (EMS) vis-a-vis the Deutsche mark from April 1979 to March 1991 are modeled as a combined MA (1)-GARCH(1, 1)-jump process. The moving average (MA) part accounts for mean reversion required for the rates to stay inside the target zone. The generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) part accounts for changing volatility, whereas the jump process models parity changes and other erratic movements. Using an adjusted Pearson chi-squared goodness-of-fit test, we find similar results for the Bernoulli and the Poisson jump processes. In those cases in which the Bernoulli-normal distribution does not pass the goodness-of-fit test, a mixture of three normals does. Finally the MA(1)-GARCH(1, 1)-Bernoulli jump models are jointly estimated assuming a constant contemporaneous correlation matrix for the disturbances and a common jump probability for all the currencies.},
